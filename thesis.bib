	phases with symmetries, which have gapless or degenerate boundary
	states as long as the symmetries are not broken. The SPT phases in
	free fermion systems, such as topological insulators, can be classified;
	however, it is not known what SPT phases exist in general interacting
	systems. We present a systematic way to construct SPT phases in interacting
	bosonic systems. Just as group theory allows us to construct 230
	crystal structures in three-dimensional space, we use group cohomology
	theory to systematically construct different interacting bosonic
	SPT phases in any dimension and with any symmetry, leading to the
	discovery of bosonic topological insulators and superconductors.},

	to be their own antiparticles. Although elementary particles of the
	Majorana type have not been identified yet, quasi-particles with
	Majorana-like properties, born from interacting electrons in the
	solid, have been predicted to exist. Here, we present thorough experimental
	studies, backed by numerical simulations, of a system composed of
	an aluminium superconductor in proximity to an indium arsenide nanowire,
	with the latter possessing strong spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman
	splitting. An induced one-dimensional topological superconductor,
	supporting Majorana fermions at both ends, is expected to form. We
	concentrate on the characteristics of a distinct zero-bias conductance
	peak and its splitting in energy-both appearing only with a small
	magnetic field applied along the wire. The zero-bias conductance
	peak was found to be robustly tied to the Fermi energy over a wide
	range of system parameters. Although not providing definite proof
	of a Majorana state, the presented data and the simulations support
	its existence.}},

  abstract = {{Semiconductor InSb nanowires are expected to provide an excellent
	material platform for the study of Majorana fermions in solid state
	systems. Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb
	hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance
	peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed
	in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect,
	the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts
	turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta InSb
	~ 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device
	in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the
	InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum
	dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic
	field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen
	to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently
	low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb
	blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed
	even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes
	when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value,
	at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is Ez ~ Delta InSb,
	is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements
	show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb
	nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor
	phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure
	can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could
	be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the
	InSb nanowire.}},

	They have been theoretically predicted to exist in topological superconductors.
	Here, we report electrical measurements on indium antimonide nanowires
	contacted with one normal (gold) and one superconducting (niobium
	titanium nitride) electrode. Gate voltages vary electron density
	and define a tunnel barrier between normal and superconducting contacts.
	In the presence of magnetic fields on the order of 100 millitesla,
	we observe bound, midgap states at zero bias voltage. These bound
	states remain fixed to zero bias, even when magnetic fields and gate
	voltages are changed over considerable ranges. Our observations support
	the hypothesis of Majorana fermions in nanowires coupled to superconductors.}},

	superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic
	system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with
	strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional
	topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron
	(Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using
	high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the
	onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of
	states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance
	of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides
	strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation
	of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic
	chains.}},

  abstract = {{Topological superconductors that support Majorana fermions have been
	predicted when one-dimensional semiconducting wires are coupled to
	a superconductor. Such excitations are expected to exhibit non-Abelian
	statistics and can be used to realize quantum gates that are topologically
	protected from local sources of decoherence. Here we report the observation
	of the fractional a.c. Josephson effect in a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor
	InSb/Nb nanowire junction, a hallmark of topological matter. When
	the junction is irradiated with a radiofrequency $f_0$ in the absence
	of an external magnetic field, quantized voltage steps (Shapiro steps)
	with a height $\Delta V = hf_0/2e$ are observed, as is expected for
	conventional superconductor junctions, where the supercurrent is
	carried by charge-2e Cooper pairs. At high magnetic fields the height
	of the first Shapiro step is doubled to $hf_0/e$, suggesting that
	the supercurrent is carried by charge-e quasiparticles. This is a
	unique signature of the Majorana fermions, predicted almost 80 years
	ago.}},
